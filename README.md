# JHU_Getting-and-Cleaning-Data_Assignment

Followings computations are been done in this project:
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
